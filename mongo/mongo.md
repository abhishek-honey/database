# Mongo


MongoDB is in many ways like a power drill. Your ability to complete a task is framed largely by the components you choose to use (from drill bits of varying size to sander adapters). MongoDB’s strength lies in versatility, power, ease of use, and ability to handle jobs both large and small. Although it’s a much newer invention than the hammer, it is increasingly a tool builders reach for quite often.
